Engr. Benedicta's Cloud Portfolio

Welcome to my first hands-on cloud computing and DevOps project! This repository showcases my practical experience with AWS EC2, Linux, Git/GitHub, and basic web deployment — all key skills for Cloud Security and DevOps roles.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following:

- **EC2 Instance Management:** Created and configured an Ubuntu server on AWS.
- **SSH Access:** Secured access to the EC2 instance using a `.pem` key with proper permissions.
- **Linux Commands:** Navigated directories, created folders, and managed files via command-line interface.
- **Git & GitHub Integration:** Initialized a Git repository, committed changes, and pushed to GitHub.
- **Web Deployment:** Created a simple HTML page and hosted it on the EC2 instance using Python's HTTP server.
